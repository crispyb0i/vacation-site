    <h1>THAILAND</h1>
  <p>If you are dreaming, you are in Thailand.</p>

  <h2>ABOUT THAILAND</h2>
  <p>Thailand is a Southeast Asian country. It's known for tropical beaches, opulent royal palaces, ancient ruins and ornate temples displaying figures of Buddha. In Bangkok, the capital, an ultramodern cityscape rises next to quiet canalside communities and the iconic temples of Wat Arun, Wat Pho and the Emerald Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Kaew). Nearby beach resorts include bustling Pattaya and fashionable Hua Hin.</p>
  <h2>PLACES TO GO</h2>
  <h3 class="bg-success">MUANG BORAN</h3>
  <p>The Pavilion of the Enlightened is not a building which ever existed elsewhere. Rather, it is a symbolic representation of a Buddhist story of 500 monks who attain Nirvana (enlightenment) despite initially having very different attributes and merits.

  <h3  class="bg-success">KO SAMUI</h3>
  <p>is an island off the east coast of the Kra Isthmus, Thailand. Geographically in the Chumphon Archipelago, it is part of Surat Thani Province, though as of 2012, Ko Samui was granted Municipality status and thus is now locally self-governing. Ko Samui is Thailand's second-largest island after Phuket, with an area of 228.7 km2, a population of over 63,000 and a hotel occupancy rate of 73 percent as the number of visitors increases.[1] Abundant tourist resources, sandy beaches, coral reefs, and coconut trees are present on the island.</p>
